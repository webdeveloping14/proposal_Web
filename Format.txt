The website should containt the following functions :
1. It should consist 4 pages : Registration page, first page, second page, third page and final page.
2. Registration page should contain a box for asking the name of the person who enters the website, and the name with time should come to me using a python file.
3. Firstly it should open the first page where in the center there should be two options "Yes" and "No" with a question "I love you, Do you love me".
4. Secondly, if anyone clicks the "Yes" button they should directly redirect to the final page where a small and cute message whould be displayed.
5. If the user clicks the "No: button it should redirect to the second page where it must be written "Think again, itni jald bazzi mt kro" and again two options "Ok, I love you too" and other one as "No, I've thought twice, I don't Love You".
6. If the user clicks the  "Ok, I love you too" button the redirect them to the final page.
7. Else redirect them to the third page where again it should display "Ab 'No' press krke dikhao" and should again have two options "Chalo thik hai, I love you too" and other "No".
8. If the user clicks on the "Chalo thik hai, I love you too"  button redirect them on the final page.
9. Else if they click on the other option, make the option move here and there at random places.
10. Conclusion for last page is that, the user willn't bw able to click the "No" option and at last he/she needs to click the "I love you too button".
